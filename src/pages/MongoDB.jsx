        <h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
        <p>
          MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which allows for more dynamic and scalable data storage. It is designed to handle large volumes of data and high-throughput applications with ease, making it a popular choice for modern web applications and data processing needs.

      <section className="mongo-features">
        <h2>Key Features of MongoDB</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Document-Oriented Storage:</strong> MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which allows for a flexible and schema-less data model. This makes it easier to work with complex data structures and adapt to changing requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalability:</strong> MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, which allows you to distribute data across multiple servers. This helps in handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Indexing:</strong> MongoDB provides powerful indexing capabilities to improve query performance. You can create indexes on any field in a document to speed up read operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aggregation Framework:</strong> MongoDB’s aggregation framework allows for advanced data processing and transformation. It provides tools for filtering, grouping, and aggregating data to generate complex reports and analytics.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="mongo-use-cases">
        <h2>Common Use Cases for MongoDB</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Content Management Systems (CMS):</strong> MongoDB’s flexible schema makes it ideal for content management systems, where the structure of the content may vary over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real-Time Analytics:</strong> MongoDB’s support for high-throughput data operations and its aggregation framework make it suitable for real-time data analytics and reporting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Internet of Things (IoT):</strong> MongoDB can handle large volumes of data generated by IoT devices and provides the scalability needed to process and analyze this data effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Catalogs and Inventory Management:</strong> MongoDB’s document-oriented storage is well-suited for managing catalogs and inventories with diverse and evolving product data.
          </li>
        </ul>
